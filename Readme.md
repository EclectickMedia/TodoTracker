# Description

As a developer, I spend a lot of my time working with plain text and to do comments. I'm sure we have all tried many various solutions for tracking our TODO comments throughout our time spent coding, but I've never found one that's simple and lightweight enough to suit my needs.

> So I made one.

TodoTracker.py simply reads every line of matching file types from the specified path for a user specified regular expression match, and outputs containing lines to a text file.

## Sample output (from my [PingStats][pingstats] library)
```
TODO MASTER (Sun Mar  4 22:10:55 2018)                  *Generated by github.com/eclectickmedia/todotracker*
--------


/Users/arianagiroux/Documents/PingStats/core.py

--------

57:    if data is None:  # TODO Should None data be handled by super?


/Users/arianagiroux/Documents/PingStats/plot.py

--------

166:        # TODO Re-enable plot labels
246:        # TODO Re-enable plotfile


/Users/arianagiroux/Documents/PingStats/tests/test_animateplot.py

--------

13:    # TODO Test `Plot.Animate.animate`


/Users/arianagiroux/Documents/PingStats/tests/test_baseplot.py

--------

8:    # TODO Test `Plot._Plot.show_plot`
```

This output text provides easily searchable and readable TODO conglomeration that can be further processed by more scripts.

# Installing from source:

Clone this repo into your desired location, and either set the shebang to your own interpreter or simply execute `$ python3 TodoTracker.py` from your command line. This script relies on standard library tools only, so should run fine with a full installation of Python3.3 or above.

# Running from source:

To launch the UI:

```bash
python3 TodoTracker.py  # Software launches, terminal session hangs until GUI closes.
```

> The script launches to the UI by default, so if you want to use the command line, you must supply the `-c` argument. *Even if you include `-h` or any other common help option, it will simply execute the UI ignoring all arguments passed to the software.*

Using the command line:

```bash
python3 TodoTracker.py -c

You must include file types to search! Use -h to view help.  # Running software without any arguments gives an error.
```

Displaying command line arguments:
```
python3 TodoTracker.py -c -h

usage: TodoTracker.py [-h] [-ee EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS] [-ef EXCLUDE_FILES]
                      [-ep EXCLUDE_PATH] [-f FILETYPES] [-oP OUTPUT_PATH]
                      [-p PATH] [-Q] [-v] [-r REGEX] [-c]

A simple applica[...]
```

Command line arguments (`python3 TodoTracker.py -c -h`):
```
python3 TodoTracker.py -c -h

usage: TodoTracker.py [-h] [-ee EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS] [-ef EXCLUDE_FILES]
                      [-ep EXCLUDE_PATH] [-f FILETYPES] [-oP OUTPUT_PATH]
                      [-p PATH] [-Q] [-v] [-r REGEX] [-c]

A simple application to update TODO's from a path. Requires the -p and -f
flags.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -ee EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS, --exclude_extensions EXCLUDE_EXTENSIONS
                        Any file extensions excluding the '.' to exclude from
                        the search, separated by commas..
  -ef EXCLUDE_FILES, --exclude_files EXCLUDE_FILES
                        Flag this option to exclude specific file names,
                        separated by by commas.
  -ep EXCLUDE_PATH, --exclude_path EXCLUDE_PATH
                        You can flag this option to exclude specific paths or
                        folders. Include folder paths by including strings
                        like "'/path/to/fake/,/folder/'". With this example,
                        if the program comes across the path '/path/to/fake'
                        or '/folder', it will just skip the search of the
                        path.
  -f FILETYPES, --filetypes FILETYPES
                        The file extensions excluding the '.' to check for,
                        separated by commas.
  -oP OUTPUT_PATH, --output_path OUTPUT_PATH
                        The path to which the software should output a to.do
                        master file.
  -p PATH, --path PATH  The path to search for TODO lines.
  -Q, --quiet           Do not output '# TODO' items as they are found.
  -v, --version         Display version.
  -r REGEX, --regex REGEX
                        The Unix standard Regular Expression to search with.
                        Defaults to "r'(?i).*# TODO.*'". Due to the way Python
                        handles Regex, you must escape all '\' characters with
                        an extra '\'; such that including the literal
                        representation of a Regex reserved character (i.e '.')
                        would require an extra '\' (i.e '\\.')
  -c, --cli             Use this flag to skip launching the applet. Use this
                        flag in conjunction with other flags to enable CLI
                        support.
