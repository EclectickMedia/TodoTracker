# TodoTracker Hopes and Dreams

--------

This software, whilst functional and very useful for lightweight terminal based `#TODO` tracking, is still missing
some functionality that are a little bit above what the software can hope to manage right now.

Ideally, this software will be able to run with a GUI and be configurable for any string of text to be caught and
notarized without having to specify a series of command line optional argument flags. 

To accomplish this, TodoTracker hopes to be able to one day utilize a full UI/UX which maintains several different
profiles. Whilst it dreams of being totally accessible via a UI, this software also hopes to maintain command line
operation to the fullest, baring no functionality available to the UI. 

The software still hopes to use a simple, text file based endpoint system so that the user can simply open their
favorite text editor and quickly review what lines have specific comment tags along with what the comment states,
whilst still being accessible within the UI.

## Specific long term goals

--------

1. Full UI/UX

2. Separate profiles with specific settings (i.e search terms/tags)

3. Tag deletion tracking.
...Maintain a list of tags that have been deleted (read: solved), and display a graph of tags deleted since project
...creation.
